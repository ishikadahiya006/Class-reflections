This class was full of important basics. To begin with the class, the instructor explained to us the course document, the topics which we are going to in the course and lastly about what kind of grading system we will be following. After this discussion, we had an interesting talk about cybersecurity. She told us how hackers can steal our information through open wifi connections, and why we need to use the internet very safely.  We also found out how network companies sometimes slow down internet speeds and sell the same service to many people for which one had already paid. Next, the instructor introduced a Git software, which helps many people work together on the same project and keep track of changes. Lastly, we learned about the Logic Gates which is a simple circuit that helps computers to make decisions. The instructor also gave us a quick idea of how the CPU works inside a computer including parts like the ALU which basically performs the calculations, registers, special registers like the accumulator, program counters and how the operating system controls each and everything.
