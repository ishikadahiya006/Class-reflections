We had a guest lecture in this class where the guest speaker talked about how quickly technology is evolving. One example he gave was of a self-parking car, which really showed how tech is making everyday life easier and convenient. The session also gave us a glimpse into how the future might look with even more advanced technologies becoming a part of our day-to-day lives.
