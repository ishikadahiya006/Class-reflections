In this class, the instructor introduced us to PowerShell, a tool which is used to manage files and folders using commands. We learned how to create new directories (folders) and move different types of downloaded files like MP3s, images, Google Docs into those folders. It was a hands-on session, and using these commands made me feel more confident about managing files on my computer more efficiently.
