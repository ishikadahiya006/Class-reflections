In todayâ€™s class, the instructor continued teaching us about Linux through WSL. We learned some basic commands, like how to create and delete directories, list all the files in a directory, and check the background processes running on the computer. We also practiced making text notes using the Pico editor and got a quick introduction to Bash (the command-line interface). Besides this, the instructor also shared a brief history of Unix and Linux, helping us understand how these systems were developed and why they are important today.
