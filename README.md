This session began with a quick round of introductions and also where each one of us shared our views on why we chose this course as our Occupational Track and what we hoped to take away from this course. While listening to everyone speak made me feel more connected to the group and it was actually very interesting to hear different perspectives and expectations as some of them were curious and a few like me were still exploring. I personally felt excited but at the same time was a bit unsure about what to expect. After the introductions, we were divided into a group of 5 members and were asked to step outside and explore the campus. So, basically our task was to explore and observe our surroundings and note down the things which could be categorized under the term technology. This activity was quite fun and also made me see each and every object very carefully and the interesting part was to notice the fact that how much of our life is surrounded and dependent on technology which we usually don't notice. Back in the class, we discussed our findings briefly before the professor took attendance and asked us to upload our group's list on Moodle. The class ended on a light note as it was a very thoughtful and interactive session and I am looking forward to all the upcoming session, activities and also to look what comes next in the course

In this class, we explored how a computer works from the inside. We also looked at different parts like the Address Line/Bus and Data Line/Bus. These are the important parts of the computer that help the memory and CPU talk to each other and make the computer run properly. It was kind of very interesting to see how each and every thing is connected and how it works together in order to move and manage the data. One of the most fascinating things which we learned was how a computer understands information. We found that the computer can only understand binary numbers which are made up of 1s and 0s. We also learned about what is the difference between normal numbers i.e, decimal and binary numbers. The professor gave us an example on how to change normal numbers into binary numbers and vice-versa. Changing the normal numbers to binary numbers was quite fun as this was the new thing which I learnt during this session.

Converting a Decimal Number to Binary Number:
To convert 64 into binary, we used repeated division by 2 and noted the remainders:
64/2 = 32, remainder 0
32/2 = 16, remainder 0
16/2 = 8, remainder 0
8/2 = 4, remainder 0
4/2 = 2, remainder 0
2/2 = 1, remainder 0
1/2 = 0, remainder 1
Now, we have to write the remainders from bottom to top: 
1000000
so, the binary representation of 64 is 1000000
Now converting a Binary Number to Decimal:
for instance, converting 1000000:
(1 x 2^6) + (0 x 2^5) + (0 x 2^4) + (0 x 2^3) + (0 x 2^2) + (0 x 2^1) + (0 x 2^0)
64 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0
64
so, 1000000 in binary numbers is equal to 64 in decimal numbers.
The professor gave us another question to convert the normal number to binary number and later we have to check the result by again converting the binary number to the normal number and after this the class got over.

This class was full of important basics. To begin with the class, the instructor explained to us the course document, the topics which we are going to in the course and lastly about what kind of grading system we will be following. After this discussion, we had an interesting talk about cybersecurity. She told us how hackers can steal our information through open wifi connections, and why we need to use the internet very safely. We also found out how network companies sometimes slow down internet speeds and sell the same service to many people for which one had already paid. Next, the instructor introduced a Git software, which helps many people work together on the same project and keep track of changes. Lastly, we learned about the Logic Gates which is a simple circuit that helps computers to make decisions. The instructor also gave us a quick idea of how the CPU works inside a computer including parts like the ALU which basically performs the calculations, registers, special registers like the accumulator, program counters and how the operating system controls each and everything.

In this class, we learned about two important parts inside a computer i.e, the Address Bus and the Data Bus. Our instructor explained how these are used to carry out actions like loading, storing, input, output, and even basic operations like add and subtract. She also talked about transistor circuits, which work like small switches or gates that control how signals pass through a computer. One of the most interesting parts for me was understanding how the ALU (Arithmetic Logic Unit) handles all the calculations, and how the results are saved in something called an accumulator. It really helped me understand how computers process data step by step.

This class was mainly a quick check on how well we have understood the concept of binary numbers. We had an online quiz on Moodle for this.

# 4th February 2025
In this class, we started by installing Windows Subsystem for Linux on our computers. After the installation we learned how to check what files and folders are in a directory, and how to open apps just by typing the commands and instead of clicking on the icons.
