This session began with a quick round of introductions and also where each one of us shared our views on why we chose this course as our Occupational Track and what we hoped to take away from this course. While listening to everyone speak made me feel more connected to the group and it was actually very interesting to hear different perspectives and expectations as some of them were curious and a few like me were still exploring. I personally felt excited but at the same time was a bit unsure about what to expect. After the introductions, we were divided into a group of 5 members and were asked to step outside and explore the campus. So, basically our task was to explore and observe our surroundings and note down the things which could be categorized under the term technology. This activity was quite fun and also made me see each and every object very carefully and the interesting part was to notice the fact that how much of our life is surrounded and dependent on technology which we usually don't notice. Back in the class, we discussed our findings briefly before the professor took attendance and asked us to upload our group's list on Moodle. The class ended on a light note as it was a very thoughtful and interactive session and I am looking forward to all the upcoming session, activities and also to look what comes next in the course

In this class, we explored how a computer works from the inside. We also looked at different parts like the Address Line/Bus and Data Line/Bus. These are the important parts of the computer that help the memory and CPU talk to each other and make the computer run properly. It was kind of very interesting to see how each and every thing is connected and how it works together in order to move and manage the data. One of the most fascinating things which we learned was how a computer understands information. We found that the computer can only understand binary numbers which are made up of 1s and 0s. We also learned about what is the difference between normal numbers i.e, decimal and binary numbers. The professor gave us an example on how to change normal numbers into binary numbers and vice-versa. Changing the normal numbers to binary numbers was quite fun as this was the new thing which I learnt during this session.

Converting a Decimal Number to Binary Number:
To convert 64 into binary, we used repeated division by 2 and noted the remainders:
64/2 = 32, remainder 0
32/2 = 16, remainder 0
16/2 = 8, remainder 0
8/2 = 4, remainder 0
4/2 = 2, remainder 0
2/2 = 1, remainder 0
1/2 = 0, remainder 1
Now, we have to write the remainders from bottom to top: 
1000000
so, the binary representation of 64 is 1000000
Now converting a Binary Number to Decimal:
for instance, converting 1000000:
(1 x 2^6) + (0 x 2^5) + (0 x 2^4) + (0 x 2^3) + (0 x 2^2) + (0 x 2^1) + (0 x 2^0)
64 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0
64
so, 1000000 in binary numbers is equal to 64 in decimal numbers.
The professor gave us another question to convert the normal number to binary number and later we have to check the result by again converting the binary number to the normal number and after this the class got over.

This class was full of important basics. To begin with the class, the instructor explained to us the course document, the topics which we are going to in the course and lastly about what kind of grading system we will be following. After this discussion, we had an interesting talk about cybersecurity. She told us how hackers can steal our information through open wifi connections, and why we need to use the internet very safely. We also found out how network companies sometimes slow down internet speeds and sell the same service to many people for which one had already paid. Next, the instructor introduced a Git software, which helps many people work together on the same project and keep track of changes. Lastly, we learned about the Logic Gates which is a simple circuit that helps computers to make decisions. The instructor also gave us a quick idea of how the CPU works inside a computer including parts like the ALU which basically performs the calculations, registers, special registers like the accumulator, program counters and how the operating system controls each and everything.

In this class, we learned about two important parts inside a computer i.e, the Address Bus and the Data Bus. Our instructor explained how these are used to carry out actions like loading, storing, input, output, and even basic operations like add and subtract. She also talked about transistor circuits, which work like small switches or gates that control how signals pass through a computer. One of the most interesting parts for me was understanding how the ALU (Arithmetic Logic Unit) handles all the calculations, and how the results are saved in something called an accumulator. It really helped me understand how computers process data step by step.

# 30th January 2025 
This class was mainly a quick check on how well we have understood the concept of binary numbers. We had an online quiz on Moodle for this.

# 4th February 2025
In this class, we started by installing Windows Subsystem for Linux on our computers. After the installation we learned how to check what files and folders are in a directory, and how to open apps just by typing the commands and instead of clicking on the icons. 

# 11th February 2025
In this class, the instructor introduced us to PowerShell, a tool which is used to manage files and folders using commands. We learned how to create new directories (folders) and move different types of downloaded files like MP3s, images, Google Docs into those folders. It was a hands-on session, and using these commands made me feel more confident about managing files on my computer more efficiently.

# 13th February 2025 
In today’s class, the instructor continued teaching us about Linux through WSL. We learned some basic commands, like how to create and delete directories, list all the files in a directory, and check the background processes running on the computer. We also practiced making text notes using the Pico editor and got a quick introduction to Bash (the command-line interface). Besides this, the instructor also shared a brief history of Unix and Linux, helping us understand how these systems were developed and why they are important today.

# 18th February 2025
This class was meant for group presentations. Each group had to choose a topic from what we had learned so far in the course and present their understanding of it. It was a great way to reflect on what we’ve covered and learn from each other’s perspectives.

# 4th March 2025
In this class, we went deeper into Linux shell commands. We learned how to use chmod to change file permissions, how to write basic bash scripts, and how to check running processes using ps-aux and ps-ef. We also practiced commands like cat, wc, and how to use pipes (|) to connect commands. One of the most useful things we learned was how to rename multiple files at once using a simple for-loop: for i in ls; do mv $i $i.txt; done. I even realized that this trick can actually save a lot of time when a person is working with many files at once.

# 6th March 2025
The class was held for a short period of time, during which we went over some of the previously learned commands as well as the codes.  

# 11th March 2025
We had a guest lecture in this class where the guest speaker talked about how quickly technology is evolving. One example he gave was of a self-parking car, which really showed how tech is making everyday life easier and convenient. The session also gave us a glimpse into how the future might look with even more advanced technologies becoming a part of our day-to-day lives. 

# 13th March 2025
We had a quiz in class to test our knowledge of Linux Commands. 

# 20th March 2025
In this class, the instructor taught us to rename multiple files at once using a simple loop command in Linux, instead of renaming each file one by one. The command for this was: for i in *; do mv "$i" "$i.txt"; done. This helped me to understand how powerful as well as time saving command line tools can be particularly when handling multiple files at the same time. 

# 25th March 2025
In this class, the instructor introduced us to a platform which is used for sending bulk emails efficiently. We also learned about hardware connections, where she explained how different computer components are connected and communicate with each other.

# 27th March 2025
In this class, the instructor explained to us the concept of IP addresses (Internet Protocol addresses) and how they help identify devices on a network. We also learned about firewalls, which basically acts as a layer of protection by hiding or blocking access to our IP address. The instructor talked about how data is packaged with additional information before being sent over the internet, and how servers accept or close connections based on requests. Key terms like HTTP (used for web browsing) and FTP (used for file transfers) were also introduced to help us understand how online communication works.

# 1st April 2025
Today’s class began with a short quiz based on our readings about internet protocols and data transmission. After that, we continued learning how to use Git inside WSL. The instructor showed us how to create using the Pico editor, adding them to a Git repository, checking their status, and committing the changes. We also explored history and how it has evolved over time into what we use today.  

# 8th April 2025
In today's class we had a really insightful guest lecture that began by exploring artificial neurons and how they are inspired by biological neurons. The speaker explained the similarities and differences between the two, which helped make the concept easier to grasp. We also learned about basic logic gates like the AND and OR gates, and how threshold functions apply to them.

The session covered Hebb's Rule, which is a foundational idea in how learning happens in neural networks. We then moved on to how artificial neurons are actually built and trained — learning about processes like the forward pass, backward pass, and how we estimate and reduce loss during training. It was a great introduction to how Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) work.
