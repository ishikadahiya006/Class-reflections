This session began with a quick round of introductions and also where each one of us shared our views on why we chose this course as our Occupational Track and what we hoped to take away from this course. While listening to everyone speak made me feel more connected to the group and it was actually very interesting to hear different perspectives and expectations as some of them were curious and a few like me were still exploring. I personally felt excited but at the same time was a bit unsure about what to expect. After the introductions, we were divided into a group of 5 members and were asked to step outside and explore the campus. So, basically our task was to explore and observe our surroundings and note down the things which could be categorized under the term technology. This activity was quite fun and also made me see each and every object very carefully and the interesting part was to notice the fact that how much of our life is surrounded and dependent on technology which we usually don't notice. Back in the class, we discussed our findings briefly before the professor took attendance and asked us to upload our group's list on Moodle. The class ended on a light note as it was a very thoughtful and interactive session and I am looking forward to all the upcoming session, activities and also to look what comes next in the course

In this class, we explored how a computer works from the inside. We also looked at different parts like the Address Line/Bus and Data Line/Bus. These are the important parts of the computer that help the memory and CPU talk to each other and make the computer run properly. It was kind of very interesting to see how each and every thing is connected and how it works together in order to move and manage the data. One of the most fascinating things which we learned was how a computer understands information. We found that the computer can only understand binary numbers which are made up of 1s and 0s. We also learned about what is the difference between normal numbers i.e, decimal and binary numbers. The professor gave us an example on how to change normal numbers into binary numbers and vice-versa. Changing the normal numbers to binary numbers was quite fun as this was the new thing which I learnt during this session.

Converting a Decimal Number to Binary Number:
To convert 64 into binary, we used repeated division by 2 and noted the remainders:
64/2 = 32, remainder 0
32/2 = 16, remainder 0
16/2 = 8, remainder 0
8/2 = 4, remainder 0
4/2 = 2, remainder 0
2/2 = 1, remainder 0
1/2 = 0, remainder 1
Now, we have to write the remainders from bottom to top: 
1000000
so, the binary representation of 64 is 1000000
Now converting a Binary Number to Decimal:
for instance, converting 1000000:
(1 x 2^6) + (0 x 2^5) + (0 x 2^4) + (0 x 2^3) + (0 x 2^2) + (0 x 2^1) + (0 x 2^0)
64 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0
64
so, 1000000 in binary numbers is equal to 64 in decimal numbers.
The professor gave us another question to convert the normal number to binary number and later we have to check the result by again converting the binary number to the normal number and after this the class got over.
