In this class, the instructor explained to us the concept of IP addresses (Internet Protocol addresses) and how they help identify devices on a network. We also learned about firewalls, which basically acts as a layer of protection by hiding or blocking access to our IP address. The instructor talked about how data is packaged with additional information before being sent over the internet, and how servers accept or close connections based on requests. Key terms like HTTP (used for web browsing) and FTP (used for file transfers) were also introduced to help us understand how online communication works.
