In this class, the instructor taught us to rename multiple files at once using a simple loop command in Linux, instead of renaming each file one by one. The command for this was: for i in *; do mv "$i" "$i.txt"; done. This helped me to understand that how powerful as well as time saving command line tools can be particularly when handling multiple files at the same time.
